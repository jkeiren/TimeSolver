-----------------------
1. Brief Program Description

	This program is a Model Checker for timed automata that uses pes (predicate equation systems).

-----------------------
2. Installing/Compiling

	To install, simply run "make".

	Running make clean will remove the files generated by compiling.

	---------------------
	2.1 Needed Libraries
		No additional libraries are needed.

-----------------------
3. Running the Program.

	The executable program is named "demo" 

	To run, use ./demo <exampleFile>

	Example files are included in the "example" directory (most are also inside another directory in the "example" directory.
		To make the examples, see the section "Generating Examples"

	Running "./build_all.sh" will compile the program and the example-generating programs.

------------------------
4. Generating the Examples

	Most examples are already there.  Some are program-generated.  To compile the programs to generate examples, either run "make" in each directory (with the desired makefile), or in the regular directory run "./build_all.sh"  This will compile the original program and the example-generating programs.

	Then, run each program and provide as a parameter the number of processes.  This will then write to standard output the generated example.  It is recommended to redirect the output to a file.
	Some folders will have various examples.
